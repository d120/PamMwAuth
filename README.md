# PwAuth authentification plugin for MediaWiki

This plugin provides authentification against both MediaWiki users and system users using PwAuth.

Two sources authentication works because of MediaWiki's default fallback behaviour. If a user doesn't exist in `/etc/passwd`, it automatically tries to 
authenticate against its own users. This is accomplished by returning `false` on `->strict()`.

Dependency: PwAuth (binary located in `/usr/local/sbin/pwauth` with setuid root flag, Version 2.3.10)
PwAuth is available at https://code.google.com/p/pwauth/
